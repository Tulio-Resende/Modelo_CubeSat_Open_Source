The model developed in this work is a reinterpretation of the model provided in the CubeDesign Virtual 2020 competition (INPE, 2020). However, the development of this project was carried out in the Xcos workspace provided by the Scilab software, whereas the competition model was made in Simulink provided by the Matlab software. Xcos is a graphical editor similar to Simulink that allows users to model dynamic systems and simulate them in discrete and continuous time domains. Due to its license being distributed for free by Scilab, this software is widely used by students and researchers. Despite having version 6.1.1 available, the version used in the development of this project was 5.5.2 (ESI GROUP, 2021) due to compatibility with some toolboxes that were used and will be described later.

The aforementioned competition involved various fields understood in a CubeSat project. However, the focus of this work is to develop only the attitude determination and control subsystem. It consists of 5 main blocks: the control block, the mechanical modeling of the reaction wheel, the dynamic part, the kinematic part, and the attitude determination.

For the development of this project, two free toolboxes provided by Scilab were necessary: the Aerospace Blockset (Scilab Module, 2018), which adds pre-structured blocks related to aerospace systems, and CelestLab (Scilab Module, 2022), which is required for the installation of the former. Both require Scilab version 5.5.2.
